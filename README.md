# Tutorial abstract
Conversational agents, or commonly known as dialogue systems,
have gained escalating popularity in recent years. Their widespread
applications support conversational interactions with users and
accomplishing various tasks as personal assistants. However, one
key weakness in existing conversational agents is that they only
learn to passively answer user queries via training on pre-collected
and manually-labeled data. Such passiveness makes the interaction modeling and system-building process relatively easier, but it
largely hinders the possibility of being human-like hence lowering
the user engagement level. In this tutorial, we introduce and discuss
methods to equip conversational agents with the ability to interact
with end users in a more proactive way. This three-hour tutorial is
divided into three parts and includes two interactive exercises. It
reviews and presents recent advancements on the topic, focusing
on automatically expanding ontology space, actively driving conversation by asking questions or strategically shifting topics, and
retrospectively conducting response quality control.
